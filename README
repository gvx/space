A space shooter. IN SPACE.

You will need LÃ–VE (http://love2d.org/) to play this thing.

For players:
This game isn't finished yet, so not everything is polished (or finished, for
that matter). If and when you find any bugs, please be so kind to file a bug
report at http://github.com/gvx/space/issues.
Most controls are what you expect. Up/Left/Right/W/A/D, Return and Escape
especially. Holding Shift enables the turbo boost, and PageUp and PageDown
(and the scrollwheel) are used for zooming. P is to pause the game.
Things to try out would be S, Tab (*especially* Tab), N, M, C, (and after
pressing C: J, K, H, L), F1 (which has a bit of explanation about the keys.
In closing: have fun, Turbo Is Your Friend, and WATCH OUT FOR THE BLACK HOLE!
